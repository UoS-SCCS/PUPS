            The Practice using Passwords project has developed lessons and tools to help older people create and use stronger passwords. By combining an introductory lesson on passwords with an interactive training site users can learn about how to generate secure passwords and then practice registering on a website and then signing in with passwords, security codes and CAPTCHAs.

            Below you will find links to a series of lessons,  which contain all the facilitated learning materials to support each of the lessons and demonstration videos showing the training site in action.  All the material and the interactive training site are available for download.
  
            Our training site has been developed to work entirely within the browser without the need for a remote server. We have created a sandboxed environment, including a simulated email account, to allow users to practice in a safe environment. The source code for our training site is open source and consists of static HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It can be mirrored on other websites to allow inclusion within existing training and outreach.
