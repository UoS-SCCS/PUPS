about: 
  - excerpt: |
        The Practice Using Passwords project has developed lessons and tools to help older people create and use stronger passwords. By combining facilitated workshop materials with a hands-on training site users can learn about how to generate secure passwords and then practice registering for a demonstrator site followed by a series of lessons on signing in with passwords, one-time passcodes and CAPTCHAs.

        Our training site has been developed to work entirely within the browser without the need for a remote server. We have created a sandboxed environment, including a simulated email account, to allow users to practice in a safe environment. The source code for a our training site is open source and consists of static HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It can be mirrored on other websites to allow inclusion within existing training and outreach.

        Below you will find links to a series of lessons, starting with an explanation of why we need strong passwords and how to generate them. This is followed by lessons on registering and signing in.
