Before beginning the interactive lessons you will need to complete the training site setup. This is easy and simply involves stepping through some instructions and providing a first name. This will configure a training account and setup a temporary training email account for use in subsequent lessons.

The following is a demonstration video of the set up steps:

On the training site if you need a reminder of what your user account name you are using then press the purple help button on the top left. This help button also will help you navigate between tabs on the training site (windows in the browser you are using).
